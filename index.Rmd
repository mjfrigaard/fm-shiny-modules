# Shiny modules: a 'field manual'

The goal for this website is to server as a 'field manual' for building shiny modules. It covers how to create modules, examples, common functions/purposes for modules, how to partition app components into smaller, more manageable (i.e. modular) pieces, and other best practices. 



# Background

As complexity grows with shiny applications, it can quickly become hard to manage all the inputs and outputs. In shiny [version 1.5.0](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html), the  [`moduleServer()` function](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.7.0/moduleServer.html) was introduced. `moduleServer()` is used with the [`NS()` function)](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.0.5/NS.html) to create modules. 

I've also included some figures and tools for helping me understand how they work. The data used in this example comes from the [`palmerpenguins` package](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

, two modules that separate the app components  (`plotMod` and `dataMod`), and a final app that combines both modules (`plotdataMod`) 

# The problem: `nsproblemApp`

`nsproblemApp` demonstrates the problem caused by namespace collision. This app has a plot and table display without no modules. It demonstrates the issue of having duplicate `inputId`s in the same namespace.

# Module 1: `plotMod`

The `plotMod` application contains a the plot module (with `plotUI()` and `plotServer()`)

# Module 2: `dataMod`

The `dataMod` application contains a the data module (with `dataUI()` and `dataServer()`)

# Module 3: `plotdataMod` 

`plotdataMod` combines `plotMod` and `dataMod` (while keeping identical input/output IDs).
